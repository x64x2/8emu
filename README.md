This implementation of a chip-8 emulator is based on this [[https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/][Guide to making a CHIP-8 emulator - Tobias V. Langhoff]].

### Progress

- [X] Start my jouney in the emulation world.
- [X] Better understanding of a guix-driven development environment.
- [X] Take a look to literate programming.
- [ ] Trying out [[https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI][FXTUI]] for the display implementation.
- [ ] Better understanding of the guix package management.
- [ ] Ironing out my emacs foo.
