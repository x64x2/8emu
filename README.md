 CHIP-8 was created by a chad named Joe Weisbecker for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer. It was intended as a much simpler way to make small programs and games for the computer back when computers were suckless. 

Instead of using machine language for the VIP’s CDP1802 processor, you could type in hexadecimal instructions that resembled machine code, but which was more high-level.
